## My name is Connor Hasting

I am a backend developer in the Healthcare industry. My day to day work requires that I pay close attention to detail by determining the proper edge cases and requirements while also ensuring that my code is scalable and extendible. Most of the time I will be working with Java, SQL and JavaScript. In my spare time I like to do photography, run, play Overwatch and tackle new challenges.
