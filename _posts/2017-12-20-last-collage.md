# LastCollage.com

The name comes from being the last website needed to create a collage of the music you have been listening to. 

The site uses the last.fm api along with jQuery to create a collage of the album covers of a user's most listened to album. Collages can be anywhere from a 2x2 to a 10x10. The time range can go from one week to the entire lifetime of the account.

The collage will display the album cover art, the artist name, the album name and the playcount(how many listens). You can customize which of the three text elements gets displayed.

Clicking on any of the album covers before turning it into an image will bring you to the full album's page on last.fm.

# Site Example

You will notice that the collage is left aligned. That is to ensure that dom-to-image doesn't add a bunch of white space into the image.
